Dear Sir,

We are a newly established NPO to start as an association to push for 
wood recycle programs within members.

I am one of the director and is now looing for opportunity to get 
funding to begin with.

When I check with your web, the above fund is directed to CMF but no 
CCMF application.  Can you advise me where I have to look into for the 
submission of the CCMF?

Best regards,
Maurice Wong
Director
Innovative Wood Recycle Association
