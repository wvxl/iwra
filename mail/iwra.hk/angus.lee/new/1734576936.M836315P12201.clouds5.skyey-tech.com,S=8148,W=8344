Hi, Benny,

Thank you for the revised undertaking and the terms and conditions are acce=
ptable to us.

Should we address to Urban Renewal Authority and for your attention?

I will be back to Hong Kong tonight and will arrange to send you the signed=
 undertaking tomorrow.

We will then arrange with the insurance company for the coverage as require=
d and then send you a copy for your reference when the policy is available.

Thank you very much for URA's kind support to our development.
