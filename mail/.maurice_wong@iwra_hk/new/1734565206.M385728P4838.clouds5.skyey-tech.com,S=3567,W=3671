Hi, Benny,

Thank you for the revised undertaking and the terms and conditions are 
acceptable to us.

Should we address to Urban Renewal Authority and for your attention?

I will be back to Hong Kong tonight and will arrange to send you the 
signed undertaking tomorrow.

We will then arrange with the insurance company for the coverage as 
required and then send you a copy for your reference when the policy is 
available.

Thank you very much for URA's kind support to our development.
